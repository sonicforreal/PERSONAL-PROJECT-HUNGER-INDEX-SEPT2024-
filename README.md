PERSONAL PROJECT (HUNGER INDEX) SEPT2024:

About Dataset
Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Undernourishment, especially in children and mothers, is a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences.
The UN has set a global target as part of the Sustainable Development Goals to “end hunger by 2030“. Currently we are far from reaching this target.
In our research on Hunger and Undernourishment we look at how many people are undernourished; where they live; childhood undernourishment; and food insecurity across the world.
There are three key physiological measures of undernourishment and undernutrition in children. The measures discussed and visualised in the sub-sections below are:
•	Stunting – being ‘too short for one’s age’;
•	Wasting – being ‘dangerously thin for one’s height’; and
•	Underweight – low weight-for-age in children.
These four indicators are:
•	Undernourishment: the proportion of undernourished people as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake);
•	Child wasting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from wasting (low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition);
•	Child stunting: the proportion of children under the age of five who suffer from stunting (low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition); and
•	Child mortality: the mortality rate of children under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments).
Scores are categorized in the following way:
•	Extremely alarming: 50 or higher
•	Alarming: 35 to 50
•	Serious: 20 to 35
•	Moderate: 10 to 20
•	Low: below 10

INSIGHTS:

This dashboard illustrates the overall trend of hunger and malnutrition affecting the world.
Somalia currently faces the highest rates of hunger, driven by ongoing conflict, economic instability, and climate-related challenges such as droughts. 
These factors contribute to severe food insecurity, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and sustainable solutions.
The yearly hunger index comparison reveals that the global hunger index has decreased since the year 2000, indicating some progress in addressing hunger worldwide.
Bangladesh has the highest rates of underweight children, stunting, and wasting. Today, the country grapples with issues such as poverty, inadequate nutrition, and limited access to healthcare, which exacerbate these challenges. 
These insights underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve child nutrition and health outcomes.
